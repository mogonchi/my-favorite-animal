        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="descritpion">This bird's-eye view, along with a highly developed sense of sight, is the giraffe's principal defence against predators because it can spot danger from a great distance. The camouflage provided by the buff-coloured hide covered with spots of darker brown is another aid to survival.

        </p>
        <p>The movement and position of a giraffe's neck are used to express emotion. When angry, a giraffe will lower its neck until it is almost horizontal. In submission, it stretches its neck and raises its nose in the air. The giraffe's neck has the same number of cervical vertebrae as a human: seven.</p>
